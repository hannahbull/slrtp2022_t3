# Baseline for SLRTP Track 3: Spotting on BSL Corpus

This repository is intended to produce a baseline method for spotting on BSL Corpus. Given a feature vector corresponding to a window of video frames, we use a simple MLP model to predict the sign gloss. 

## To train the model:

```bash train.sh``` 

## To evaluate the model on the test set: 

```bash test.sh```

This create a file called `submission.csv`, which may be uploaded to the CodaLab server.
